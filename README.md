Google-Image-Search

This app allows you to search for images using Google IMage Search API. Following features are achieved in this app:
1. User can enter a search query that will display a grid of image results from the Google Image API.
2. User can click on "settings" which allows selection of advanced search options to filter results
3. User can configure advanced search filters such as:
    Size (small, medium, large, extra-large)
    Color filter (black, blue, brown, gray, green, etc...)
    Type (faces, photo, clip art, line art)
    Site (espn.com)
4. Subsequent searches will have any filters applied to the search results
5. User can tap on any image in results to see the image full-screen
6. User can scroll down “infinitely” to continue loading more image results (up to 8 pages)

Advanced Features:
1.  Use the ActionBar SearchView or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
2.  Replace Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay
